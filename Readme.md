_Warning: this is hardly production code._
I hacked my Monopoly game to see if bankruptcy was possible in a certain game scenario. Since this was just for curiosity's sake, it's broken: it gets unresponsive in some browsers, but it works somewhat in Chrome.

This is a basic JavaScript/HTML/CSS Monopoly implementation. Up to eight players can play at once. If you're familiar with Monopoly, game play should be fairly self-explanatory. But if you have trouble, hovering the mouse over a control will usually display more information. Please report any issues you find.

New: Added capability to play against an AI. A AI for demonstration purposes only is included. A future update will include a more realistic opponent.
